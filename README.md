# plotness
An R package improving upon the vcd library's displot function. Allows the user to produce Poisonness, binomialness, and negative binomialness plots with ggplot or to get the necessary data to plot with the user's preferred graphics library.

Ever have a need to make a Poisonness, binomialness, or negative binomialness plot but want it to look prettier than the base R plot of the vcd library's distplot function? Look no further!
